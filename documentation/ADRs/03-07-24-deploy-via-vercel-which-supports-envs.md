## Deploy via Vercel

Backend and frontend deployment via Vercel. 
More infos about that in the [deployment.md](/documentation/deployment.md) file.

### Build-in support for ENVs

Vercel offers easy secret / ENV handling.  
Just entering all necessary ENVs in the vercel GUI makes them accessible
in the code and stored safely by Vercel.  
This provides an easy and convenient solution for dealing with ENVs for our purpose.
