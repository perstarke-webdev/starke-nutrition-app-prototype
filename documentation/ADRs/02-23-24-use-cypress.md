## Use the cypress tool for frontend testing

Mainly made for easy E2E testing. 
Allows component testing as well, but I will focus on E2E testing for now, 
meaning testing the whole app / function instead of single components,
to have tests assuring a good-working "flow" of the app. 
This also allows for testing the frontend with calls to the backend API.
